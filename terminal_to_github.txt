pwd = check the present working directory
cd = change directory to another folder (like cd Desktop/exercises)

Add the file you want to upload into the local folder (github clone) on your computer

git status = checks if the folder you're in is a git repository and if there's an untracked file (not yet on github)

Then type: 
git add filename.txt
git commit -m "describe‚Äù
git push origin master

OR INSTEAD YOU CAN DO git add . = this 2nd version will add any files that haven't yet been added (as opposed to filename.txt only adds one file)

IF YOUR LOCAL & GITHUB FILES DIVERGE:
git pull origin master

then, when you're in merging window:
escape :wq
